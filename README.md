# Pyzzle

Welcome to Pyzzle! A game engine for making 2D puzzle games using python!

## Installation

First, get python3 installed. It is available [on the official python site.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Then you'll need to install SFML, there are tutorials on how to do that [here.](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/)

After you have installed SFML, run this command in the project root to build the python module.
